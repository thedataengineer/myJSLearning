# My JavaScript learning
## Introduction
This repository contains all of my code I wrote as I refreshed my learning on JavaScript (full stack).
### About Me
You guys don't know me. I have started my career as a C#/ASP.NET developer in 2006 after having learnt C as a 10 year old and kept relearning it through 2003.
Later, my job took me places and I moved to become a SQL Developer, SSIS developer, SSRS Developer, then to become an Informatica Developer and then a Data Architect and so on.
But, now I am getting an opportunity to come back to my basics.
Since, it has been a decade since I did serious programming and given that the technology landscape has changed and so much, I have decided to do a fresher and hence this.
